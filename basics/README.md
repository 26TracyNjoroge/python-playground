# Python Basics  

This folder contains my practice projects for learning the foundations of Python.  
I am currently on a Generative AI training, where we will be using **Jac**.  

Since Jac is built on top of Python, it is important to understand Python basics in order to use Jac effectively.  
These projects help me strengthen the fundamentals I need for the training, while also improving my coding and problem-solving skills.  

## Goals of This Folder  
- Practice Python syntax and foundations  
- Build confidence with small projects  
- Connect Python basics to Jac usage later in my training  

##  Topics Covered  
- Variables & data types  
- Conditionals (`if/elif/else`)  
- Loops (`for`, `while`)  
- Functions  
- Input/output
