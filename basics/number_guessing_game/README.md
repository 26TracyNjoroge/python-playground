# Number Guesser Game  

A simple Python guessing game where players try to guess a randomly generated number within 1 - 15 range.  


## How to Play  
- The computer randomly selects a number within the given range.  
- You guess the number by entering your choice.  
- The game provides hints:  
  - `"Too high!"` if your guess is above the target number  
  - `"Too low!"` if your guess is below the target number  
  - `"You have guessed correctly!"` when you guess the right number  
- Try to guess the number in as few attempts as possible!  

## Features  
- Random number generation  
- Input validation  
- Hint system (higher/lower feedback)
